## Probiotic Live Salmonella Vaccine Ceca Content 16S rRNA

The goal of this study was to determine whether probiotic supplementation in feed (PRO), immunization with an oral, live Salmonella vaccine (VAX), or the combination of probiotics and live Salmonella vaccination (P+V) led to unique alterations of the ceca microbiome in 5 week-old layer pullets (SRA repository, BioProject ID SUB5641933). Using methods detailed in this GitHub page, we found that vaccinated birds had similar beta diversity regardless of probiotic supplementation. Additionally, we found Enterobacteriaceae, Akkermansia, and cc-115 were uniquely elevated in PRO, VAX, and P+V birds, respectively. Several potentially pathogenic taxa (Mollicutes, Treponema, etc) were reduced regardless of experimental treatment.
